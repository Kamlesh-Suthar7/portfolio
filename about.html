        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Kamlesh Suthar</strong>, from <em>Kadiya, Udaipur (Rajasthan)</em>.</p>
        <p>I completed my education till 8th grade from <strong>Sanskar Jyoti Private School</strong>, and then did my
            12th from <strong>Mahatma Gandhi Government School, Badgoan</strong>.</p>
        <p>Since childhood, I've enjoyed <strong>sketching</strong>, <strong>drawing</strong>, and playing
            <strong>volleyball</strong>. These hobbies have always helped me stay creative and active.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm pursuing <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science (AI & ML)</strong> from <strong>Sir Padampat
                Singhania University</strong>. I've completed my <strong>first year</strong>, and now I'm in the
            <strong>3rd semester</strong> of my second year.</p>
        <p>After coming to college, my interest in the <strong>technical field</strong> has grown a lot. I've started
            learning <strong>coding</strong> and exploring <strong>web development</strong>, which have now become part
            of my hobbies too. I love creating things that work and learning something new every day.</p>
